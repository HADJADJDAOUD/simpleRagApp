ðŸ“Œ What is RAG?
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI technique that combines:

Retrieval: Fetching relevant information from a knowledge source (like your PDF).

Augmented Generation: Using an LLM (e.g., GPT) to generate answers based on the retrieved content.

Unlike a standard chatbot, RAG provides accurate, context-aware responses by first searching your document before generating an answer.
